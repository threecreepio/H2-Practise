# Threecreepio Hades 2 Practise

https://github.com/threecreepio/H2-Practise

This is a practise rom that lets you easily test out different builds, and jump to different encounters.

## Usage

When you start Hades, press "Insert" to enter the Lua menu.
There will be a Practise window open, if not it should be under the "Windows" menu.

Inside the practise window there are a few different tabs:

### Saved Builds

This tab lets you save and load whatever setups you want to use when testing.
The saves contain all your boons, selected weapon, keepsake, familiar and health/mana.

At the top right you can quickly create new saves which will be added to the list. If you expand a save you can see some of those details, as well as delete or move the save, and copy the full save data to your clipboard as text.

The import button lets you paste in the save files that were created by copying them to your clipboard. That way you could share your save between game files, or to other people.

### Build

In the build tab you can directly add boons and other items. At the top you can quickly remove everything to go back to the default state, and you can also restore full health and mana.

Under that are a lot of expandable panels.

The Consumables panel lets you add any number of regular items, you can add health, magic, coins, and well items.

In the panel for each god you can hover over each boon to see its tooltip, as well as the requirements to receive the boon. When changing rarity or number of upgrades you also get a preview tooltip for the change.

### Encounters

The encounters menu lists up a number of different scenarios that can be started.
It has a quick warp back to the pre-run room in the Crossroads, as well as to the start of each region in the game.

There is also a warp to each guardian, as well as each miniboss in every region.

They will load in with your arcana and vows, so if you want to practise against rivaled bosses for example, you will need to make sure to configure that before starting the encounter. Using the Vow of Time doesn't work well, you will start at 0 seconds remaining.
